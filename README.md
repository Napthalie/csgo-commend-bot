# CSGO Commend Bot

This is a simple commend bot written in JavaScript, simply because its the language I am the most familiar with.

# Side features

This bot has 2 side features, a report bot and a server-report bot.

I will not explain a lot about those 2 side features, just follow the examples. The one without suffix are the normal commend bot. The majority of the config is based off of the normal [config.json](#config), just one or two things are different.

## Report Bot:

- The `MatchID` is optional, just leave it empty (`""`) if you do not want to use it
- Report cooldown is 24 hours per report
- Optional Command Line Arguments: `node index_report.js <Account> <Amount> [MatchID]`

## Server-Report Bot:

- The `MatchID` is **required**. You cannot report a server otherwise.
- Report cooldown is unknown, I just put it to 24 hours
- Optional Command Line Arguments: `node index_reportserver.js <MatchID> <Amount>`

I heard in the past that reporting a server for bad performance will cancel the match, I cannot confirm this myself. 500 reports did nothing to the server, I'll leave it in the script anyways.

# Removing commends

**This is experimental and might not work as intended**

- Adjust `config_undoCommends.json`
- Run `node index_undoCommends.js`

The bot should now remove some commends, ofcourse you can only remove the commends you sent yourself and not of other players. It is **required** for the user to be in the "Commended" list of the accounts.json else the bot will not be treated as being able to uncommend.

# Account To Commend

You can enter any of the following formats:

- SteamID: `"STEAM_0:0:11101"` (String)
- SteamID3: `"[U:1:22202]"` (String)
- SteamID64: `"76561197960287930"` (String)
- ProfileURL: `"https://steamcommunity.com/id/gabelogannewell/"` **OR** `"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197960287930"` (String)
- VanityURL: `"gabelogannewell"` (String)
- AccountID: `22202` (Number)

**Don't have a SteamAPI Key? Just keep using the AccountID as a Number and it will not make a SteamAPI request**

# Account Parsing

Use the `parseAccountList.js` in order to parse a list of `account:password` into a compatible format. To use this just rename your file to `input.txt` or change line 10 in the script. By default it will append all accounts to the list already present in `accounts.json`. If you want to fully override all accounts in the `accounts.json` change `AppendToFile` from `true` to `false` in the script at line 1. To run it just enter `node parseAccountList.js`.

# Command Line Arguments

You can define up to 2 command line arguments.

The first one is always the SteamID you want to commend bot, it accepts any of [these](#account-to-commend) formats as long as there is no space in it.

The second argument is always the amount of commends you want to send.

Both are optional, if one doesn't exist the default [config](#config) value will be used.

`node index.js [AccountToCommend] [CommendsToSend]`

Examples:

- `node index.js` - Will start the commend bot using the `config.json`
- `node index.js gabelogannewell` - Will start the commend bot and will commend accountid `22202` with `config.json`-CommendsToSend's commends
- `node index.js https://steamcommunity.com/id/gabelogannewell/ 10` - Will start the commend bot and will commend accountid `22202` with `10` commends

# Proxies

Generally you do not need a proxy, if all of your login requests are successfully completed you barely get limited by steam at all, do 100 every 10 seconds and it should be fine. The only issue is when you fail to login or do not finish the login, then Steam might restrict you for up to 2 hours from logging into any account.

Use an empty array (Eg: `[]`) if you do not want to use any proxies

`SwitchProxyEvery` in the config defines how many chunks share the same proxy.

[HTTPS Proxies are **not** supported](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-steam-client#sethttpproxyproxyurl)

# Account List Manager

This module will help in parsing and cleaning the account list

**Syntax**
- `node accountmanager.js [--clean] [--available] [--delete]`

**Arguments List**
- `--clean` - Will clean the `accounts.json` file by removing duplicate entries and removing entries with empty username/password
- `--available` - Will show the number of accounts available to commend
- `--delete <usernames>` - Will remove the accounts from the accounts list. You can remove multiple accounts at once by providing the usernames separated by space
